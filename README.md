# epic-mowing-simulator
 This is a lawn mowing game I made in Unity over the course of a week-long spring break in high school.

 It's nothing fancy, but I enjoyed making it, and I learned a lot.
 
 If you want to play it, there is a built version included in the Builds folder. Make sure to play version 0.2
